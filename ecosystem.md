# Ecosystem

This [discourse post](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/the-graphs-ecosystem/99463) is an accurate summary (as of Spring 2023) of the graphs ecosystem.
Below we list a few highlights.

## Graph packages outside of the organization

> More coming soon

### Plotting

- [GraphMakie.jl](https://github.com/MakieOrg/GraphMakie.jl)

## Packages using graphs

These packages (and many others) import [Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl) to do cool things:
