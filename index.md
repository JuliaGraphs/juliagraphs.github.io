# What is Julia?
[Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing"](http://julialang.org).
It is free (open source) and supports Windows, OSX, and Linux. It has a familiar
syntax, works well with external libraries, is fast, and has advanced language
features like metaprogramming that enable interesting possibilities for
Graphsimization software.


# What is JuliaGraphs?
JuliaGraphs is an organization that brings together packages written in Julia
for using and studying graphs.

<!-- - **Overview**: [presentation]() and [workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnL7yLMVu6c) from JuliaCon 2015 -->
