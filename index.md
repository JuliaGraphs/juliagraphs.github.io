# JuliaGraphs

## Presentation

[Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) are mathematical structures that model sets of vertices connected by edges.
They appear everywhere in our daily lives, from transportation networks to molecular structures or social media.

[Julia](http://julialang.org) is a high-level, high-performance programming language designed for technical computing.
It is free (open source), has an accessible syntax, and supports Windows, OSX, and Linux.

[JuliaGraphs](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs) is a GitHub organization run by volunteers, which tries to coordinate and foster the development of graph algorithms in Julia.
You can check out our [core packages](./packages), find out what the broader [ecosystem](./ecosystem) does with them, or watch the talks in our [gallery](./gallery).

## Finding support

For general usage questions, please use the [Julia Discourse forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/) and tag your post with `#graphs`.

If you found a bug in one of our packages, or if you want to suggest a feature, feel free to open an issue on GitHub.
Remember that open source development is not our main job, so your request may take a while to process.
We thank you for your patience!

## Contributors

The maintainers of the JuliaGraphs organization are listed [here](https://github.com/orgs/JuliaGraphs/people).
Each package also has its own GitHub repository listing individual contributions.
